A young, energetic girl named Alice skipped happily down the street, enjoying the warm, sunny day, surrounded by birds singing happily. However, as Alice neared the end of the street, she noticed that her favorite tree had been chopped down overnight and was now laying on the ground, lifeless and sad. The once cheerful song of the birds had now become silent and somber as the reality of the situation settled in. Alice's expression changed from happiness to disappointment as she looked at the fallen tree, knowing that it would never sing its beautiful melody again. The sky suddenly darkened and rain began to fall.
